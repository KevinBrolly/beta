"7550b0ac-ba7b-4d34-842d-5c7c34452ebc","Respite and Short Breaks from Caring","Getting a break from caring is very important for many carers. We provide advice and assistance to find a break that will work for both the carer and the person they care for. This could be just getting a bit of time for yourself in the day through to help with booking appropriate respite breaks for a week or two. We can help ensure that the Council provides funding for a break and sometimes also identify other sources of funds to make breaks affordable.","https://www.coel.org.uk/","0131 665 0135","centre@coel.org.uk","www.aliss.org/services/respite-and-short-breaks-from-caring-0/","www.aliss.org/services/7550b0ac-ba7b-4d34-842d-5c7c34452ebc/","2018-11-30 12:43:21.171855+00:00","432bd8ad-7fe7-43d1-9bf6-85fb237962d2","Carers of East Lothian","www.aliss.org/organisations/432bd8ad-7fe7-43d1-9bf6-85fb237962d2/","""Respite"" ","aliss.ServiceArea.None","""62f05853-418b-4f55-88d0-6236153c309a"" "

These are a great opportunity to meet other people in the same situation and to share experiences. Groups are informal and welcoming – as one carer told us “the friendship, the atmosphere & the interaction between us all is great. The realisation other people have the same difficulties is important.
