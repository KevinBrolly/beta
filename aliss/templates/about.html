                    <h3>ALISS vision</h3>
                    <p>We believe that people of Scotland living with long term conditions, disabled people and unpaid carers should be able to access the information they need to help them live well.</p>
                    <p>The ALISS (A Local Information System for Scotland) Programme is funded by the Scottish Government and delivered by the Health and Social Care Alliance Scotland (the ALLIANCE).</p>
                    <p>ALISS key objectives are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To increase the availability of health and wellbeing information for people living with long term conditions, disabled people and unpaid carers</li>
                        <li>To support people, communities, professionals and organisations that have information to share</li>
                        <li>To ensure that stakeholders are informed, skilled and confident in the use and application of web services and that they are connected as part of a wider community of practice</li>
                        <li>To ensure that ALISS is used and is strategically aligned with Scottish health and social care needs</li>
                    </ul>
