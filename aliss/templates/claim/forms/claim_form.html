        <p>As an account owner (person who has claimed an organisation), I understand and accept the following responsibilities:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>An organisation can be claimed by someone from the organisatiion with a central overview.</li>
            <li>All claims need to be approved by the ALISS team.</li>
            <li>If someone claims an organisation, they automatically claim all services attached to the organisation. Find more about the <a href="help.html"> Editor </a>role.</li>
            <li>If you claim an organisation and become the Account Owner, you will be responsible for ensuring that information is kept up-to-date.</li>
            <li>Please read the <a href="aliss/static/pdf/ALISS_data-standards.pdf">Data Standard</a> before claiming the organisation.</li>
